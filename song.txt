I've paid my dues time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
And I need to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions - my friend
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions of the world
